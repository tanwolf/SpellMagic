    "_Background:_ \n",
    "Correcting texts using ChatGPT is more efficient for dyslexic writers than a spell check alone. Combining ChatGPT with Microsoft OneNoe Notebook creates an accessible work environment which includes a screen reader, a dictation tool, a spell checker and much more. The notebook structure also allows to organize the text and the writing process itself efficiently. Parents and caretakers: Do not let your child use ChatGPT unsupervised. Learning how to use it responsibly takes time, practice and guidance. Consider creating a custom bot using the openAI API for your child. I will explain how to do this in another notebook. Also, when working with ChatGPT make sure to never paste confidential data into the bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The paid ChatGPTPlus version uses GPT4 instead of GPT3,5. Text correction within GPT4 is even more accurate than within GPT3,5."
