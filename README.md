# SpellMagic
This project aims to empower dyslexic children, their parents, and caretakers. Rather than concentrating on forms of therapy and special education, however, this project aims to create a digital working environment for dyslexic children and their supporters. The goal of this digital environment is to reduce overwhelm in order to focus on literacy and text comprehension.

The digital environment strives to be collaborative and integrates analog tools such as magnetic letters, flashcards, colored pens, and games with digital tools such as Microsoft OneNote, Google Colab, and Miro. This project explores ways to safely incorporating GPT3,5 into such an environment. As the Microsoft 365 Copilot for OneNote has not been released yet, this project explores ChatGPT (for parents and caretakers) and the OpenAI API (for students). 

From the perspective of the dyslexic child, the goal is to empower them to correct their self-written texts and to generate study materials for literacy, spelling, and foreign langauge learning from these texts. The project utilizes the openAI API to develop text correction and processing tools specifically designed for dyslexic students.

As an accessible digital workspace is not only beneficial to dyslexic children, the outcomes of this project will also be applied to other target groups such as 
- teachers
- therapists
- parents who are not native speakers of their child's language of instruction
