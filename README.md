# SpellMagic: LLM-Supported Assistive Technology for Dyslexic Students

Introduction
Welcome to SpellMagic, a project designed to empower dyslexic students and their parents. The project's goal is to make text comprehension and foreign language learning accessible and engaging. By leveraging advanced technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), SpellMagic creates an inclusive digital workspace for learning and exploration. A special focus is put on digital tools which integrate well with traditional study materials such as magnetic letters, flashcards or colored paper and pens.

Target Audience
This project is primarily aimed at parents of dyslexic children, equipping them with the necessary tools to collaborate effectively with their children, teachers, and therapists to set up an accessible learning environment.

During the development phase, the project will explore various tools and features not limited to the ones listed below:

Features
OCR, Speech-to-Text, and Text-to-Speech: Integrating with Apple, Windows, and Google Drive functionalities.
Immersive Reader and Reading Progress: Utilized within Microsoft Word, Edge, OneNote, and Microsoft Teams.
Microsoft OneNote: For web clipping, note-taking, and text structuring.
AnkiCards: Custom digital flashcard creation for vocabulary learning.
MaxQDA: Qualitative analysis of text, audio, and video files.
Google Colaboratory: Simple Python NLP scripts and API calls to Large Language Models (LLMs).
Streamlit App: Custom application development for interactive learning.

Language Learning Presentation Project
In addition to the core functionalities of SpellMagic, the [AI powered Language Learning Project](https://medium.com/@tanja_wolf/ai-powered-language-learning-fusing-tech-with-cultural-immersion-87c828353604) focuses on transforming the way students interact with foreign languages. Utilizing a Python script, song lyrics are transformed into a multisensory language learning experience, presented through PowerPoint slides. This unique approach incorporates the NLP Python library spaCy alongside APIs like DeepL, GPT-4, and Narakeet, to not only translate but also provide context and cultural insights into the learning materials. The project aims to make language learning more accessible and immersive.
