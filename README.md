# SpellMagic: LLM-Supported Assistive Technology for Dyslexic Students

This project aims to empower dyslexic children and their parents. The aim is to create an LLM-supported digital work environment which fosters text comprehension, literacy training and foreign language learning. In addition, analog tools such as magnetic letters, flashcards, colored pens, and games are seemlessly integrated into this work environment. The goal is to foster and understanding of how text is procesed by humans and by LLMs amd how the letter can help with text comprehension.

One of the main goals of this project is to develop tools which allow dyslexic children to:
* correct their self-written texts
* generate study materials for literacy, spelling, and foreign language learning from their texts

As an accessible digital workspace is not only beneficial to dyslexic children, the outcomes of this project will also be applied to other target groups such as 
- teachers
- therapists
- parents who are not native speakers of their child's language of instruction

This project will explore tools such as:
- OCR, speech-to-text and text-to-speech functions within apple and windows devices as well as within google drive 
- Immersive Reader in Micrososft Word, Edge and OneNote
- Reading Progess in Microsoft Teams
- Microsoft OneNote for web clipping and structuring text
- AnkiCards
- MaxQDA for web clipping as well as qualitative analysis of text, audio, and video files
- Google Colaboratory for writing simple python NLP scripts and for making API calls to LLMs 
- Streamlit App for developing custom apps
