# SpellMagic: LLM-Supported Assistive Technology for Dyslexic Students

This project aims to empower dyslexic children and their parents. The aim is to create an LLM-supported digital work environment which fosters text comprehension, literacy training and foreign language learning. In addition, analog tools such as magnetic letters, flashcards, colored pens, and games are seemlessly integrated into this work environment.  

One of the main goals of this project is to develop tools which allow dyslexic children to:
* correct their self-written texts
* generate study materials for literacy, spelling, and foreign language learning from their texts

As an accessible digital workspace is not only beneficial to dyslexic children, the outcomes of this project will also be applied to other target groups such as 
- teachers
- therapists
- parents who are not native speakers of their child's language of instruction
